# Stage 1: Basics of NumPy

✅ **Goal:** Be comfortable with NumPy arrays and basic operations.

---

## 1. Installing NumPy

To install NumPy, use pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

To check installation:

```python
import numpy as np
print(np.__version__)
```

---

## 2. The `ndarray` Object

The **ndarray** is the core data structure of NumPy. Think of it as a **grid of numbers** (like a list of lists, but much faster and more powerful).

Important properties:

* `shape`: dimensions of the array (rows, columns)
* `dtype`: data type of the elements (int, float, etc.)
* `size`: total number of elements
* `ndim`: number of dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D, …)

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print("Array:\n", arr)
print("Shape:", arr.shape)   # (2, 3)
print("Size:", arr.size)     # 6 elements
print("Dimensions:", arr.ndim) # 2D
print("Data Type:", arr.dtype)
```

---

## 3. Array Creation

NumPy provides many ways to create arrays:

### a) From Python lists

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(arr)
```

### b) Zeros and Ones

```python
zeros = np.zeros((2, 3))
ones = np.ones((3, 3))
```

### c) Range of numbers

```python
ar = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # start=0, stop=10, step=2
print(ar)  # [0 2 4 6 8]
```

### d) Evenly spaced values

```python
lin = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)  # 5 points between 0 and 1
print(lin)  # [0.   0.25 0.5  0.75 1.]
```

---

## 4. Indexing and Slicing

Like Python lists, but more powerful.

```python
arr = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]])

print(arr[0, 1])   # 20 (row 0, col 1)
print(arr[:, 1])   # column 1 → [20, 50]
print(arr[1, :])   # row 1 → [40, 50, 60]
print(arr[0:2, 0:2]) # subarray
```

---

## 5. Reshaping and Flattening

Changing the structure of arrays.

```python
arr = np.arange(12)  # [0, 1, ..., 11]
reshaped = arr.reshape(3, 4)  # 3 rows, 4 cols
print(reshaped)

flat = reshaped.ravel()  # flatten back to 1D
print(flat)
```

---

## 6. Broadcasting

**Broadcasting** lets you do operations on arrays of different shapes automatically.

Example 1: Adding a scalar

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr + 10)  # [11 12 13]
```

Example 2: Adding arrays of different shapes

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
B = np.array([10, 20, 30])
print(A + B)
# [[11 22 33]
#  [14 25 36]]
```

---

## 7. Practice Exercise

Try these on your own:

1. Create a 2D array of shape (4,4) with values from 1–16.
2. Slice the 2nd row and 3rd column separately.
3. Reshape the array into (2,8).
4. Flatten it back into 1D.
5. Add a constant number (say 5) to all elements using broadcasting.
6. Multiply each column by `[1, 2, 3, 4]` using broadcasting.

✅ By finishing Stage 1, you’ll be **comfortable with arrays, indexing, reshaping, and broadcasting** — the foundation for everything else in NumPy.
