    "While modules allow you to organize code within a single file, **packages** take it a step further. A package is essentially a directory containing multiple modules (and possibly sub-packages) along with a special `__init__.py` file. They provide a way to group related modules, preventing naming conflicts and making code easier to manage and distribute, especially in larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Module:** A single `.py` file (e.g., `math_operations.py`).\n",
    "  * **Package:** A folder containing multiple related `.py` files (modules), potentially other subfolders (sub-packages), and an `__init__.py` file (e.g., a folder named `my_science_tools` containing `math_operations.py`, `physics_formulas.py`, etc.).\n",

    "### 1\\. What is a Package? (and why use them?) 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python package is a directory that contains a collection of Python modules and typically an `__init__.py` file. This directory structure allows for a clear hierarchy and organization of related code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use Packages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Modularity:** Break down large applications into smaller, manageable, and reusable units.\n",
    "  * **Namespacing:** Prevents naming conflicts. For example, you can have a `utils.py` module in two different packages without them clashing.\n",
    "  * **Reusability:** Share collections of modules across different projects.\n",
    "  * **Distributability:** Packages are the standard way to distribute Python libraries (e.g., using PyPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Package Structure 🏗️\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical package structure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_project/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── main.py                    # Your main script\n",
    "│\n",
    "└── my_package/                # This is your package directory\n",
    "    ├── __init__.py            # Marks 'my_package' as a Python package\n",
    "    ├── module_a.py            # A module inside 'my_package'\n",
    "    ├── module_b.py            # Another module\n",

    "        └── sub_module_y.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The role of `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__.py` file is crucial. Its presence tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package. Even if the file is empty, it serves this purpose. Without it, Python will not recognize the directory as a package, and you won't be able to import modules from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Creating a Simple Package ✍️\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple package named `geometry` that contains modules for `shapes` and `calculations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create the directory structure.**\n",
    "You'll need to create these directories and files manually or via your terminal/IDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Step 2: Add content to the modules.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`geometry/__init__.py` (can be empty for now):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# geometry/__init__.py\n",
    "# This file can be empty. Its presence makes 'geometry' a package.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4.1. Absolute Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute imports use the full path from the project root. This is generally recommended for clarity and avoiding ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: Absolute Imports ➡️\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming you are running this from 'my_project' directory\n",
    "# (or Jupyter's current working directory is 'my_project')\n",

    "import geometry.shapes\n",
    "import geometry.calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Area of circle with radius 5: {geometry.shapes.circle_area(5)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Perimeter of square with side 6: {geometry.shapes.square_perimeter(6)}\")\n",

    "\n",
    "print(f\"Hypotenuse of sides 3 and 4: {geometry.calculations.hypotenuse(3, 4)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Distance between (0,0) and (3,4): {geometry.calculations.get_distance((0,0), (3,4))}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can also import specific items:\n",
    "from geometry.shapes import circle_area, Triangle\n",
    "from geometry.calculations import hypotenuse as h\n",

    "print(f\"Hypotenuse (alias h): {h(6, 8)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2. Relative Imports (`.` and `..`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative imports are used *within* a package to import modules from the same package or a sub-package. They are helpful for keeping imports concise when modules are closely related within a package structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `.`: Refers to the current package.\n",
    "  * `..`: Refers to the parent package.\n",
    "  * `...`: Refers to the grandparent package, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example within `geometry/calculations.py` if it needed `circle_area` from `shapes.py`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*(We won't run this code here, but imagine it in `geometry/calculations.py`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# geometry/calculations.py (hypothetical addition)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is an example of a relative import from another module within the same package\n",
    "from .shapes import circle_area\n",
    "\n",
    "def hypotenuse(side_a, side_b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return (side_a**2 + side_b**2)**0.5\n",

    "def get_distance(p1, p2):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points (tuples).\"\"\"\n",
    "    x1, y1 = p1\n",
    "    x2, y2 = p2\n",
    "    return ((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)**0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_complex_area(radius, side_a, side_b):\n",
    "    # Now we can use circle_area directly\n",
    "    circle = circle_area(radius)\n",
    "    tri_hyp = hypotenuse(side_a, side_b)\n",
    "    return circle + tri_hyp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note on Relative Imports:**\n",
    "Relative imports *only* work when the Python file is part of a package that is being imported. They will cause a `ModuleNotFoundError` if you try to run the file directly as a script (e.g., `python shapes.py`). This is why absolute imports are often preferred for top-level scripts like `main.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\\. `__init__.py` in Detail 🔑\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__.py` file isn't just a marker; it can contain Python code that gets executed when the package (or sub-package) is imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1. Empty `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen, an empty `__init__.py` is sufficient to define a directory as a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2. Initialization Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put initialization code directly into `__init__.py`. This code will run *once* when the package is imported for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Let's modify geometry/__init__.py\n",
    "# geometry/__init__.py\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Initializing the 'geometry' package...\") # This message will appear on import\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can also import commonly used items to make them directly available\n",
    "# when someone imports the package itself\n",
    "from .shapes import circle_area, Triangle\n",
    "from .calculations import hypotenuse\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, if you import 'geometry', you can access circle_area directly via geometry.circle_area\n",
    "# This is useful for exposing key functionalities.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see this in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: __init__.py Initialization 🔑\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you've run the above cells, the geometry package might already be loaded.\n",
    "# To see the effect of the 'print' statement in __init__.py clearly,\n",
    "# you might need to restart your kernel and run this cell first.\n",
    "# Or, use importlib.reload (though reload doesn't re-execute __init__ if it's already there in fresh state)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's assume a fresh import:\n",
    "import geometry\n",
    "# You should see \"Initializing the 'geometry' package...\" printed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"\\nAccessing items exposed in __init__.py:\")\n",
    "print(f\"Area of circle via package: {geometry.circle_area(8)}\")\n",
    "my_other_triangle = geometry.Triangle(10, 5)\n",
    "print(f\"Area of other triangle via package: {my_other_triangle.area()}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Hypotenuse via package: {geometry.hypotenuse(5, 12)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can still access individual modules explicitly\n",
    "print(f\"\\nAccessing items via module directly:\")\n",
    "print(f\"Perimeter of square from shapes module: {geometry.shapes.square_perimeter(7)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.3. Defining `__all__`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__all__` variable in `__init__.py` is a list of strings that defines what names are imported when a user does `from package import *`. It's a way to control the public interface of your package.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Let's modify geometry/__init__.py again\n",
    "# geometry/__init__.py\n",

    "from .calculations import hypotenuse, get_distance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define what '*' import should expose\n",
    "__all__ = [\"circle_area\", \"Triangle\", \"hypotenuse\"]\n",
    "# Note: 'get_distance' is intentionally left out\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's demonstrate the effect of `__all__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: __all__ in __init__.py 🔑\n",
    "\n",
    "# You might need to restart kernel or clear outputs to see the print statement again\n",
    "import importlib\n",

    "importlib.reload(geometry) # Reload to pick up the __init__.py changes\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nDemonstrating 'from geometry import *'\")\n",
    "# This will import only names specified in geometry.__all__\n",
    "from geometry import *\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"circle_area directly accessible: {circle_area(2)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Triangle directly accessible: {Triangle(3, 4).area()}\")\n",
    "print(f\"hypotenuse directly accessible: {hypotenuse(8, 15)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # This will cause a NameError because 'get_distance' was not in __all__\n",
    "    print(f\"get_distance directly accessible: {get_distance((0,0), (1,1))}\")\n",
    "except NameError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error! {e}. 'get_distance' was not included in __all__.\")\n",

    "### 6\\. Installing and Using Third-Party Packages (via Pip) 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the Python libraries you'll use (like NumPy, Pandas, Requests, Django) are third-party packages distributed through the Python Package Index (PyPI). `pip` is the standard package manager for Python and is used to install these packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use `pip` (from your terminal/command prompt):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Install a package:** `pip install package_name`\n",
    "      * e.g., `pip install requests`\n",
    "  * **Install a specific version:** `pip install package_name==1.2.3`\n",
    "  * **Upgrade a package:** `pip install --upgrade package_name`\n",
    "  * **Uninstall a package:** `pip uninstall package_name`\n",
    "  * **List installed packages:** `pip list`\n",
    "  * **Generate requirements.txt (for sharing dependencies):** `pip freeze > requirements.txt`\n",
    "  * **Install packages from requirements.txt:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try installing a popular package, `requests`, to make an HTTP request. (You would typically run `pip install requests` in your terminal *before* running this code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: Installing and Using Third-Party Packages 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "# First, ensure you have 'requests' installed:\n",
    "# Open your terminal/command prompt and run: pip install requests\n",

    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7\\. Best Practices for Package Structure ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Flat is better than nested (initially):** Don't over-nest packages. Start with a flat structure and only create sub-packages when your module count grows and logical grouping becomes necessary.\n",
    "  * **Clear Naming:** Use clear, lowercase, singular names for modules and packages (e.g., `utils`, `database`, `api`).\n",
    "  * **`__init__.py` for Exposition:** Use `__init__.py` to expose the most important functions/classes directly at the package level, making imports cleaner for users.\n",
    "  * **Relative Imports within Package:** Use relative imports (`.`, `..`) within your package for internal module-to-module communication.\n",
    "  * **Absolute Imports for External Code:** Always use absolute imports when importing from outside your package (e.g., in your `main.py` script or another project).\n",
    "  * **`__all__` for `from package import *`:** Define `__all__` in `__init__.py` to explicitly control what `import *` brings in.\n",
    "  * **Docstrings:** Provide good docstrings for your packages, modules, functions, and classes.\n",
