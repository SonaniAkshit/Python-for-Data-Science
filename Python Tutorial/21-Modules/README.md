# 📦 Python Modules

---
### 1. What is a Module? 🤔
At its simplest, a module is a `.py` file containing Python definitions and statements. When you create a Python script and save it with a `.py` extension, that file itself is a module.

#### Why use modules?

- **Reusability:** Write code once, use it in many places.
- **Organization:** Keeps code logically structured and easy to manage.
- **Namespacing:** Prevents naming conflicts between different parts of your project.
- **Collaboration:** Different team members can work on different modules simultaneously.

### 2. Creating Your Own Module ✍️
Let's create a simple module named `my_calculator.py`. We'll put some basic math functions inside it.
