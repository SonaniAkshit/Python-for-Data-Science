    "# Python Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python are simply files containing Python code. They provide a way to logically organize your code, break large programs into smaller, manageable, and reusable files. Imagine them as toolboxes, each filled with related tools (functions, classes, variables) that you can bring into your current project whenever you need them.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## üìö Related Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are often discussed alongside or build upon these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Packages:** üìÅ A collection of modules in directories, providing a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "  * **Functions:** ‚öôÔ∏è The core building blocks often contained within modules.\n",
    "  * **Classes:** üèóÔ∏è Blueprints for objects, also commonly defined in modules.\n",
    "  * **Variables:** üìä Data stored within modules.\n",
    "  * **`import` Statement:** ‚û°Ô∏è The primary way to bring module content into your current script.\n",
    "  * **`__name__` attribute:** ü§î Used to determine if a module is being run directly or imported.\n",
    "  * **`sys.path`:** üõ£Ô∏è Where Python looks for modules.\n",
    "  * **Virtual Environments:** üåê Isolated Python environments for managing project dependencies, often involving modules.\n",

    "### 1\\. What is a Module? ü§î\n",
    "\n",
    "At its simplest, a module is a `.py` file containing Python definitions and statements. When you create a Python script and save it with a `.py` extension, that file itself is a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use modules?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Reusability:** Write code once, use it in many places.\n",
    "  * **Organization:** Keeps code logically structured and easy to manage.\n",
    "  * **Namespacing:** Prevents naming conflicts between different parts of your project.\n",
    "  * **Collaboration:** Different team members can work on different modules simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Creating Your Own Module ‚úçÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple module named `my_calculator.py`. We'll put some basic math functions inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you would create a file named `my_calculator.py` in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook (or wherever your main script is).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a file named 'my_calculator.py' with the following content:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "# my_calculator.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# A simple module for basic arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PI = 3.14159 # A constant variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Adds two numbers and returns the sum.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "def subtract(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Subtracts the second number from the first.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a - b\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Multiplies two numbers.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Divides the first number by the second. Handles division by zero.\"\"\"\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        return \"Error: Cannot divide by zero!\"\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "def greeting(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Returns a personalized greeting.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the calculator module.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# This part runs only if the module is executed directly\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"This is my_calculator.py being run directly!\")\n",
    "    print(f\"2 + 3 = {add(2, 3)}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"5 - 2 = {subtract(5, 2)}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"PI value: {PI}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We defined a constant `PI`, and several functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `greeting`).\n",
    "  * The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is a common Python idiom. Code inside this block only runs when the script is executed directly (e.g., `python my_calculator.py`) and *not* when it's imported as a module into another script. This is useful for putting test code or examples within your modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Importing Modules ‚û°Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how to use the functions and variables from our `my_calculator.py` module in another Python script or in this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1. `import module_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common way. It imports the entire module, and you access its contents using `module_name.item`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: import module_name ‚û°Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "import my_calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Using my_calculator.add(10, 5): {my_calculator.add(10, 5)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Using my_calculator.PI: {my_calculator.PI}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Greeting from module: {my_calculator.greeting('Alice')}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2. `import module_name as alias`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give the module a shorter, more convenient alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: import module_name as alias ‚û°Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "import my_calculator as mc\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Using mc.multiply(7, 8): {mc.multiply(7, 8)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Using mc.divide(100, 4): {mc.divide(100, 4)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3. `from module_name import specific_item`\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to import only specific functions, classes, or variables from a module directly into your current namespace. You can then use them without the `module_name.` prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: from module_name import specific_item ‚û°Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "from my_calculator import add, subtract, greeting\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Using add(20, 10) directly: {add(20, 10)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Using subtract(50, 15) directly: {subtract(50, 15)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Direct greeting: {greeting('Bob')}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Try to use something not imported - it will cause an error\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(multiply(3, 3))\n",
    "except NameError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error! {e}. 'multiply' was not imported directly.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4. `from module_name import item1, item2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing multiple specific items is just an extension of the previous method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: from module_name import item1, item2 ‚û°Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "from my_calculator import add, PI\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Adding 5 and PI: {add(5, PI)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5. `from module_name import *` (Caution\\! ‚ö†Ô∏è)\n",
    "\n",
    "This imports *all* public names (those not starting with an underscore `_`) from a module directly into your current namespace. While convenient, it's generally **discouraged** because it can lead to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Name Collisions:** If you import `*` from multiple modules, or if your script has variables with the same names, you might overwrite things unintentionally.\n",
    "  * **Readability Issues:** It becomes harder to tell where a function or variable came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- end list -->\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: from module_name import * (Use with caution! ‚ö†Ô∏è)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't do this in large projects unless you fully understand the implications\n",
    "from my_calculator import *\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Directly calling divide(10, 2): {divide(10, 2)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Directly accessing PI: {PI}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of a potential name collision\n",
    "# If you had your own 'add' function here, it would be overwritten\n",
    "def add(x, y, z):\n",
    "    return x + y + z\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"My local add(1,2,3): {add(1,2,3)}\") # This is MY add function\n",
    "# The 'add' from my_calculator is now shadowed/overwritten in this scope\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you want to use my_calculator's add, you'd need to re-import it explicitly\n",
    "# or avoid 'import *' in the first place and use 'import my_calculator'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\\. Module Search Path üõ£Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "When you `import` a module, Python searches for it in a specific order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The directory containing the input script:** The current directory where your script is running.\n",
    "2.  **`PYTHONPATH` (if set):** An environment variable that lists additional directories.\n",
    "3.  **Standard library directories:** Locations where Python's built-in modules are installed.\n",
    "4.  **The contents of `.pth` files:** Site-specific configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inspect the search path using the `sys` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: Module Search Path üõ£Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Python's module search path (sys.path):\")\n",
    "for path in sys.path:\n",
    "    print(f\"- {path}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can temporarily add a path (useful for testing or specific scenarios)\n",
    "# sys.path.append('/path/to/my/custom_modules')\n",
    "# print(\"\\nPath after adding custom_modules:\")\n",
    "# for path in sys.path:\n",
    "#     print(f\"- {path}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\\. `dir()` Function üîç\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dir()` function returns a list of names (attributes, functions, classes) defined in a module, object, or the current scope. It's great for exploring what's available in an imported module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: dir() Function üîç\n",
    "\n",
    "import math # A standard library module\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Contents of the 'math' module:\")\n",
    "print(dir(math))\n",
    "print(\"\\nSome specific items from math:\")\n",
    "print(f\"math.pi: {math.pi}\")\n",
    "print(f\"math.sqrt(25): {math.sqrt(25)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nContents of our 'my_calculator' module:\")\n",
    "print(dir(my_calculator))\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can also use dir() without arguments to see current local scope\n",
    "# print(\"\\nContents of current local scope:\")\n",
    "# print(dir())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6\\. The `__name__` Attribute ü§î\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Python module has a special built-in attribute called `__name__`. Its value depends on how the module is being used:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If the module is being run directly as a script, `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "  * If the module is imported into another script, `__name__` is set to the module's name (e.g., `\"my_calculator\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is commonly used to include code that should only run when the script is executed directly (e.g., tests, setup code, command-line interfaces). We saw this in `my_calculator.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: The __name__ Attribute ü§î\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you run this Jupyter cell, this script itself is being executed directly,\n",
    "# so its __name__ is '__main__'.\n",
    "print(f\"This script's __name__ is: {__name__}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "import my_calculator # When my_calculator is imported, its __name__ is 'my_calculator'\n",
    "print(f\"my_calculator's __name__ is: {my_calculator.__name__}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remember the __name__ block in my_calculator.py:\n",
    "# if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "#     print(\"This is my_calculator.py being run directly!\")\n",
    "# This line *did not* print when we imported it above.\n",
    "# It would only print if you ran `python my_calculator.py` from your terminal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7\\. Reloading Modules üîÑ (For development)\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, if you modify a module file (`.py`) while your Python interpreter (or Jupyter kernel) is still running, `import` statements won't pick up the changes because Python caches imported modules. To see the changes without restarting, you can use `importlib.reload()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: Reloading Modules üîÑ\n",
    "\n",
    "import importlib\n",
    "import my_calculator # Initial import\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Initial PI value: {my_calculator.PI}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# ----- Imagine you edit 'my_calculator.py' file NOW -----\n",
    "# Change PI from 3.14159 to 3.0 in my_calculator.py\n",
    "# Add a new function like 'power(base, exp)'\n",
    "\n",
    "# To see these changes, we need to reload:\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- Please manually edit 'my_calculator.py' now ---\")\n",
    "print(\"  - Change `PI = 3.14159` to `PI = 3.0`\")\n",
    "print(\"  - Add a new function: `def power(base, exp): return base ** exp`\")\n",
    "print(\"  - Save the file.\")\n",
    "input(\"Press Enter after you've saved the changes to my_calculator.py...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, reload the module\n",
    "importlib.reload(my_calculator)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"\\nAfter reloading, PI value: {my_calculator.PI}\")\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(f\"Using new power function: {my_calculator.power(2, 3)}\")\n",
    "except AttributeError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error accessing new power function (did you save the file correctly?): {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8\\. Standard Library Modules üìñ\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a vast collection of pre-installed modules, known as the \"Standard Library.\" These modules provide functionalities for almost anything you can imagine, from file operations and regular expressions to network communication and mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commonly used standard library modules include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `math`: Mathematical functions (e.g., `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `pi`).\n",
    "  * `random`: Generating random numbers.\n",
    "  * `datetime`: Working with dates and times.\n",
    "  * `os`: Interacting with the operating system (e.g., file paths, directories).\n",
    "  * `sys`: System-specific parameters and functions.\n",
    "  * `json`: Working with JSON data.\n",
    "  * `re`: Regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- end list -->\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tutorial: Standard Library Modules üìñ\n",
    "\n",
    "import math\n",
    "import random\n",
    "import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Square root of 16: {math.sqrt(16)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Value of pi from math module: {math.pi}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Random number between 1 and 10: {random.randint(1, 10)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Random float between 0.0 and 1.0: {random.random()}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "now = datetime.datetime.now()\n",

    "## Conclusion üéâ\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now got a solid grasp of Python Modules\\! They are the backbone of writing organized, reusable, and maintainable Python code.
